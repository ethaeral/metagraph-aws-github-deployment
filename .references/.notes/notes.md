Goal:   
Spin up a github development to aws production environment for constellation metagraph   

Current pain points:   
Trying to format cloudformation template to reflect what is needed in the euclid dev enironment   
Understanding   

Next steps:   
✔️ From scripts understand in what docker scripts run in what order in infra/docker  
// After understanding the configuration of ea. node and cluster translate it to cloudformation template  
From infra/docker - find a way to just docker context and then docker compose up:
